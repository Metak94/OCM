4. Match schedule will be settled by the Tournament Management (see below).
5. If no staff or referee is available, the match will be postponed.
6. Failed players' scores do not get added to the team score.

7. Use of the Visual Settings to alter background dim or disable map elements like storyboards and skins are allowed.
8. If the beatmap ends in a draw, the game will be nullified.
9. If a player disconnects, they get treated as if they failed the map.

### Tournament Registration

1. Every user interested in joining their country's team signs up individually.
   - Tournament Management will create a list of potential candidates for a country's team.
   - Tournament Management declares one candidate to the captain of the country's team, albeit temporarily.
   - The declared captain can form their team from the candidate list of their country.
