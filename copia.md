## Ruleset

### Tournament Rules

1. This version of the OCM is a team tournament, played on the osu!catch game mode. 
2. This competition is a 2 versus 2 setup, and the team size can be up to four members.
3. Score V2 will be used.
4. The tournament is open to all player, there's no restriction of country or region.
5. Failed players' scores do not get added to the team score.
   - Reviving and surviving during a map is considered as passing it.
6. If the beatmap ends in a draw, there will be a rematch on the same map.
7. If a player disconnects, they get treated as if they failed the map.
   - The map can be rematch if the disconect was about 30 seconds after the map begins. This is up to the referee's discretion.
8. If a team presents one member, the match can be posponed up to 10 minutes. After that period, default will be declared.
9. Map selectors and tournament organizers are NOT allowed to play, while referees and streamers can do so without problems.
10. I hope there is a good atmosphere between all teams, the team or player who is toxic or disrespectful to any staff member (or any team) will be immediately disqualified from the tournament.

### Match Instructions
1. Each team is free to select up to one warm-up map.
2. Each captain has to roll a number. Both teams can ban one beatmap to be selected from the pool starting from the loser of the roll. These beatmaps are not allowed to be picked by any team in the entire match.
3. The winner of the roll has the first pick.
4. Beatmap selection will alternate between each captain selecting a beatmap out of the map pool.
5. **After a team reaches 3 points the opposition can ban again, like a comeback mechanic.**. 
6. On this second ban, the team can choose between ban another map or a player:
   - Ban a player means that **one member of the enemy team cant play the next map**.
